/**
 * A heuristic function for nodes in a {@link Graph}.<p>
 *
 * A {@code Heuristic} provides a rough estimate of the lowest path cost from a provided
 * node in a {@link Graph} to a target node. The cost of a path is the sum of the weights
 * of its constituent edges.<p>
 *
 * Although a heuristic may be inaccurate, it should be quick to evaluate, and it is used
 * by informed search algorithms, such as <i>A*</i> or <i>Best-first Search</i>, to decide
 * which nodes to explore with a higher priority.<p>
 *
 * A heuristic estimate must never be less than zero. If the provided node is a target
 * node, the estimate for that node should be zero.
 *
 * <h2>Consistent heuristics</h2><p>
 * A heuristic is said to be <i>consistent</i> if its estimate is always less than or equal
 * to the estimate for any neighbour of the provided node, plus the cost of reaching that
 * neighbour from the provided node.<p>
 *
 * Consistency is a desirable property for heuristics. When the <i>A*</i> algorithm uses a
 * consistent heuristic, it is guaranteed to always return a path with the lowest cost possible.
 *
 * @param <N> the type of graph nodes this heuristic evaluates
