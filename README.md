# JWalker
An extremely generic Java library for applying *A** and other built-in search algorithms to user-defined graphs.

## Overview
- **Generic**: Suitable for literally any problem that can be solved with a search algorithm
- **Customizable**: Define custom graphs and heuristics
- **Efficient**: The built-in algorithms use an efficient Fibonacci heap, borrowed from [jheaps](https://github.com/d-michail/jheaps)
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies

The [jwalker-examples](https://github.com/epieffe/jwalker-examples) repository contains example projects to demonstrate how easy it is to use JWalker to solve any search problem.

### ðŸ¤Œ How to use
Define your own custom graph by creating a class that implements the [Graph](src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/Graph.java) interface, along with a separate class for the nodes in your graph.

Once you have a *Graph*, you are ready to use the *Dijkstra* or *Breadth-First Search* built-in algorithms to find an optimal path from a starting node to a target node.

If you want to use an informed search algorithm such as *A** or *Best-First Search*, you need to provide a heuristic for your nodes by implementing the [Heuristic](src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/Heuristic.java) functional interface.

### âš¡Quick example
The following code snippet uses the built-in *A** algorithm to find an optimal solution for an instance of the [N-Puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

The example classes are borrowed from the [jwalker-examples](https://github.com/epieffe/jwalker-examples) repository.

```java
import eth.epieffe.jwalker.Edge;
import eth.epieffe.jwalker.Graph;
import eth.epieffe.jwalker.Heuristic;
import eth.epieffe.jwalker.Visit;
import eth.epieffe.jwalker.Visits;

// Define a starting 8-Puzzle configuration
NPuzzle start = NPuzzle.newInstance(1, 3, 8, 4, 6, 7, 5, 2, 0);
// The N-Puzzle Graph is a singleton
Graph<NPuzzle> graph = NPuzzleGraph.INSTANCE;
// Use the sum of the manhattan distances from each cell to its target position as heuristic
Heuristic<NPuzzle> heuristic = NPuzzleHeuristics::manhattanSum;
// Create a visit for N-Puzzle using A*
Visit<NPuzzle> visit = Visits.aStar(graph, heuristic);
// Find an optimal path from the starting configuration to the target configuration
List<Edge<NPuzzle>> path = visit.run(start);
```

See the implementation of the example classes at [NPuzzle](https://github.com/epieffe/jwalker-examples/blob/main/npuzzle/src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/example/npuzzle/NPuzzle.java), [NPuzzleGraph](https://github.com/epieffe/jwalker-examples/blob/main/npuzzle/src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/example/npuzzle/NPuzzleGraph.java) and [NPuzzleHeuristics](https://github.com/epieffe/jwalker-examples/blob/main/npuzzle/src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/example/npuzzle/NPuzzleHeuristics.java).

## Built-in algorithms
Here we describe the built-in search algorithms. Users might also add new algorithms by implementing the corresponding Java interface.

### ðŸ§  Visits
A [Visit](src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/Visit.java) traverses a graph to find a path from a provided node to a target node. Some visits are guaranteed to find a path with the lowest cost possible, while other visits sacrifice path optimality in exchange for efficiency.

#### built-in visits:
- A* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm))
- Best First ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search))
- BFS ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search))
- Dijkstra ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm))

### ðŸ”Ž Local searches
A [LocalSearch](src/main/java/eth/epieffe/jwalker/LocalSearch.java) starts from one or more randomly generated nodes and navigates the graph until a node deemed optimal is found or a time bound is elapsed. It is used to solve computationally hard optimization problems. Unlike visits, a local search does not return a path, but only one node is returned.

The returned node is not guaranteed to be optimal, subsequent runs might find a better node.
